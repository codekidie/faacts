                      <center>Passage 1</center>

                      <center><h5>The Count of Monte Cristo</h5>
                              <p><b>-Adapted-</b></p> </center>
                      <p>In 1807, during the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, a young shoemaker in Paris named Francois Picaud suffered a fate similar to that of the man in the mask. Learning that Picaud was to marry the beautiful Marguerite Vigoroux, a jealous friend named Mathieu Loupian falsely informed the police that the shoemaker was an English agent. Napoleon's police seized Picaud and threw him in prison, where he languished in anonymity until 1814. </p>

                      <p>During his seven years of captivity, Picaud befriended an Italian prelate who, on his deathbed, told him of a hidden fortune. Upon his release, the embittered prisoner found the treasure and returned to Paris a wealthy man. In Paris, he learned not only of Loupian's duplicity but of Marguerite Vigoroux's subsequent marriage to the man who had betrayed him. .Appearing in various disguises, Picaud set out to avenge himself on Loupian and his fellow conspirators — killing them one by one until he himself was slain by one of his intended victims. The story, published in 1838, caught the attention of the novelist Alexandre Dumas. </p>

                      <p>Some years earlier Dumas had been shooting on an island near Elba, the place of Napoleon's first exile. In the distance, he saw a rocky islet rising from the sea. Its name was Monte Cristo. Enchanted with the vista, Dumas vowed to write a novel using the name. After reading Picaud's tragic history, the novelist adapted it to create The Count of Monte Cristo.</p>

                      <p>Like Picaud, Dumas' hero Edmound Dantes is unjustly imprisoned owing to the treachery of friends — accused by them for being a conspirator in the plot to return the exiled emperor to power. Like Picaud, Dantes befriends a fellow inmate, an Italian prelate, and learns of a hidden treasure. But here, the novelist's imagination takes over. When the priest dies, Dantes takes his place in the burial sack that is thrown in the sea, swims to safety, and is picked up by a gang of smugglers. Taken by his rescuers to the island of Monte Cristo, the hero finds a fortune in gold and jewels in an underground cavern. Posing as the Count of Monte Cristo, Dantes returns to Paris to seek revenge.</p>

                      <center>Passage 2</center>
                      <p>The membership of guilds in medieval European towns was made up of masters, journeymen, and apprentices. Each guild differed from town to town in its social and political influence, but its primary economic function was the same everywhere - to protect the merchant and artisan, not just from the competition, of foreign merchants, but also from the competition of fellow guild members. Town markets were closed to foreign products, and individual members were prevented from growing rich at expense of others.</p>

                      <p>Each guild strict rules, including fixed hours of work, fixed prices and wages, limits on the number of workers in workshop, and regular workshop inspection. These tightly enforced rules had the effect of dampening personal ambition and initiative. No one was allowed to employ methods that were cheaper or more efficient than those used by fellow guild members. In fact, technical progress and those who favored it where looked down on with suspicion.</p>

                      <p>Each local guild was organized hierarchically. The dominant members where the masters – small merchant proprietors of workshop who owned their tools, raw materials, products, and all the profit from the sale of those products. Journeymen were wage-earning workers who had completed an apprenticeship. Apprentices were brought in under a trade under a master’s direction. The number of masters in each local guild was limited, determined by the need of the local market and by certain requirements, including citizenship that were hard to fulfill.</p>

                       <p>The master functioned as a small independent entrepreneur whose primary capital included a house workshop, tools, and equipment. The number of workshop employees was restricted, usually to one or two apprentices and journeymen. If a master happened to inherit or marry into a fortune, it could not be used against other masters, because the guild system left no room for competition. But material inequality among guild merchant was rare. For most of them, the economic structure of the guild meant the same kind of existence and the same resources. While it gave them a secure position, it also prevented them from rising above it. In this sense, the guild system be described as non-capitalist.

                      <center>Passage 3 </center>
                      <p>
                          There is one fact about the origin of life which is reasonably certain. Whenever and wherever it happened, it started a very long time ago, so long ago that it is extremely difficult to form any realistic idea of such vast stretches of time. The shortness of human life necessarily limits the span of direct personal recollection. 
                      </p>  

                      <p>  Human culture has given us the illusion that our memories go further back than that. Before writing was invented, the experience of earlier generations, embodied in stories, myths and moral precepts to guide behavior, was passed down verbally, or, to a lesser extent, in pictures, carvings, and statues. Writing has made more precise and more extensive the transmission of such information and, in recent times, photography has sharpened our images of the immediate past. Even so, we have difficulty in contemplating steadily the march of history, from the beginnings of civilization to the present day, in such a way that we can truly experience the slow passage of time. Our minds are not built to deal with periods as long as hundreds or thousands of years.

                      <p>
                        While fats have lately acquired a bad image, one should not forget how essential they are. Fats provide the body’ means of storing energy, a far more efficient energy source than either carbohydrates or proteins. They act as insulation against cold, as cushioning for the internal organs, and as lubricants. Without fats, energy would have no way to utilize fat-soluble vitamins. Furthermore, some fats contain fatty acids that contain necessary growth factors and help with the digestion of other foods.
                       </p>  

                        <p>An important consideration of fat intake is the ratio of saturated fats to unsaturated fats. Saturated fats, which are derived from dairy products, animal fats, and tropical oils, increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol may lead to coronary heart disease by building up in the arteries of the heart. However, unsaturated fats, derived from vegetable oils, tend to lower serum cholesterol if taken in a proportion twice that of saturated fats. </p>

                        <p>The consumption of a variety of fats is necessary, but the intake of too much fat may lead to a variety of health problems. Excessive intake of fats, like all nutritional excesses, is to be avoided.

                      <p>
                         Ambient divers, unlike divers who go underwater in the submersible vehicles or pressure resistant suits, are exposed to the pressure and temperature of the surrounding (ambient) water. Of all types of diving, the oldest and simplest is free diving. Free divers may use no equipment at all, but most use face masks, foot fins, and snorkels. Under the surface, free divers must hold their breath. Most free divers can only descend 30 to 40 feet, but some skilled divers can go as deep as 100 feet.
                         </p>

                     <p> Scuba diving provides greater range than free diving. The word "scuba" stands for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus." Scuba divers wear metal tanks with compressed air or other breathing gases. When using open-circuit equipment, a scuba diver simply breathes air from the tank through a hose and releases the exhaled air into the water. A closed-circuit breathing device, also called a rebreather, filters out carbon dioxide and other harmful gases and automatically adds oxygen. This enables the diver to breathe the same air over and over. </p>
      

                     <p>In surface-supplied diving, divers wear helmets and waterproof canvas suits. Today, sophisticated plastic helmets have replaced the heavy copper helmets used in the past. These divers get their air from a hose connected to compressors on a boat. Surface-supplied divers can go deeper than any other type of ambient diver can.
